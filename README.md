# hotelSite-fullstack
A project for CS532-Software Engineering that was an attempt to make a full stack website for a fictional hotel, Ophelias Oasis for G.Leonard at SDSU.

# *Keynotes*:
-**Project Manager**

-The purpose of this project was more focused on **documenting** project goals, **delegating** between group mates, and **self-teaching** new technologies in a short amount of time

-Most of front end was constructed using bootstrap by group mates *Kyle Gloria* and *Andrew Botros*

-the project was built over the course of a month which also included the self teaching of MERN stack

-the database CRUD operations are available only on the local machine

-My major pieces of contribution was server side and api calls from front end to back end

# *Defects*:

-The site was meant to be deployed onto a cloud server using heroku services, that goal was not met

-Major functionality was not implemented because of focus on integration between front and back end frameworks
